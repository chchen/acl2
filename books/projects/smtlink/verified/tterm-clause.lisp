; tterm-clause: produce an ACL2 clause corresponding to tterm
; This version constructs an expression with 'implies' and 'if' where the
; if-expression is a "translated" and.  We might want to just create the
; clause directly:
; (list ,(not (tterm-p (quote ,tterm)))
;       ,(not ,(tterm-correct-expr tterm))
;       ,(tterm->expr tterm))
; But I'm leaving it in the current form for now to be close to Yan's
; representation.  The big difference between tterm-clause and what Yan
; does is that I'm including tterm in the goal so the next clause processor
; can recover it.

; (tterm-parse-clause cl) -> (mv fail tterm)
;   cl should be the pseudo-termp returned by (disjoin clause) where clause
;     is a list of disjuncts, where each disjunct satisfies termp.
;   If cl has the form of a clause constructed by (tterm-clause tterm),
;     tterm-parse-clause returns (mv nil tterm).
;     In this case, we ensure (see tterm-parse-clause-when-good-cl) that
;       for any context, a, either (tterm-correct-p tterm a) holds or cl
;       is vacously satisified, e.g. a type-hypotheses of cl is violated
;       in context a.  We also ensure that (tterm->expr tterm) implies
;       cl in any context a.
;   Otherwise cl does not have the form of a clause constructed by
;     (tterm-clause tterm), and (tterm-parse-clause cl) reutrns (mv fail tterm)
;     where fail is not nil, and tterm satisfies tterm-p (to make guard and
;     returns theorems happy.  The current implementation returns t for
;     fail in this case.
;     TODO: write smt:fail((info acl2::any-p)) -> nil.  Then, we can
;     return clauses that will fail, but the info argument will give
;     potentially useful feedback to the user.
